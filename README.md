# Introduction 
Enables the VMInsights Solution for a Workspace.
Enables Linux and Windows PerformanceCounters.

Nothing special to do. Just run `terraform apply` or use as module as usual. For documentation view `./docs`.

# Build and Test
The module is tested by deploying and destroying a basic example once.

# Contribute
You can contribute by creating new branches (`features/` or `fix/`) and creating Pull-Requests.
